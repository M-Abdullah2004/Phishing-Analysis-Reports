# Phishing-Analysis-Reports
This repository is an ongoing collection of phishing email analysis reports that I create as part of my practice in threat analysis and documentation. Phishing samples are sourced from the open-source project rf-peixoto/phishing_pot, and each report demonstrates my ability to investigate, analyze, and clearly document findings in a SOC-style format.

I will continue adding new phishing samples and their analysis reports as I practice more.
